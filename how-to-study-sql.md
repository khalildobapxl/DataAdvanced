Oh, I hear you—expecting code to work perfectly on paper is like assuming your USB stick will magically plug in right-side-up on the very first try. In both cases, reality laughs in your face. But since Oracle doesn’t let you “flip it once, flip it again” when your semicolon refuses to compile, here’s how to minimize the chances of a face-palm when that examiner hands you the paper and a blue pen:

---

## 1. Treat the “on-paper” exam like a dry-run IDE

1. **Draw the Block Skeleton First**

   * Always start by sketching the naked bones of your PL/SQL block:

     ```plsql
     CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE your_proc_name (
       -- params…
     ) IS
       -- declarations…
     BEGIN
       -- logic…
     EXCEPTION
       -- exception handlers…
     END your_proc_name;
     /  
     ```
   * Even if it’s just an anonymous block, write:

     ```plsql
     DECLARE 
       -- vars…
     BEGIN
       -- actions…
     EXCEPTION
       -- handlers…
     END;
     ```
   * **Why?** Because once you’ve drawn the box, it’s harder to accidentally forget your named `END` or misplace your `EXCEPTION` section. It’s like marking the USB port before you try to insert—better visibility.

2. **Write Declarations in Logical Order**

   * List your variables, cursors, and exceptions top-to-bottom, grouping them by purpose. For example:

     1. Custom exceptions
     2. Cursor definitions (if any)
     3. Scalar variables (use `%TYPE` where possible)
   * **Tip:** Put `%TYPE` right next to your variable to remind yourself of the table/column name:

     ```plsql
     v_emp_sal  EMPLOYEES.SALARY%TYPE;
     v_emp_name EMPLOYEES.FIRST_NAME%TYPE;
     e_no_emp   EXCEPTION;
     PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(e_no_emp, -20010);
     ```
   * This way, you’re less likely to mix up datatypes or mis-spell a column name.

3. **Outline the Logic with Pseudocode**

   * Before diving into exact SQL syntax, jot down “in English” what you need to do:

     1. Fetch salary INTO v\_emp\_sal
     2. IF no data, RAISE exception
     3. Calculate new salary (`v_emp_sal * (1 + pct/100)`)
     4. UPDATE EMPLOYEES SET salary = new\_value
     5. COMMIT
     6. Exception handlers: NO\_DATA\_FOUND, OTHERS
   * Then translate each step into code.
   * **Why?** Because once your pencil hits the “UPDATE…” line, you won’t be wondering, “Wait—what came next?”

## 2. Dry-run every line as you write it

1. **Simulate the SQL in Your Head (or on a Scrap)**

   * Suppose you write:

     ```plsql
     SELECT salary  
       INTO v_emp_sal  
       FROM EMPLOYEES  
      WHERE employee_id = p_emp_id;  
     ```
   * Immediately think:

     * If `p_emp_id` doesn’t exist, NO\_DATA\_FOUND is thrown.
     * If it does exist, v\_emp\_sal gets a number—great.
   * If you’re writing a `FOR UPDATE` clause, double-check that you actually need it (and remember to COMMIT or ROLLBACK).
   * **Tip:** On paper, draw a mini-table（or just list a few employees you know from the HR schema), pick `p_emp_id = 105`, and mentally fetch `salary = 6000`. You’ll catch typos like “WHERE employeeID” vs. “employee\_id” before the examiner does.

2. **Check Every Semicolon & Comma**

   * Missing semicolons are the paper-exam equivalent of “USB upside-down.”
   * Write a small mark in the margin next to each line that needs a semicolon; then, before you move on, mentally (or with your finger) ensure there’s a “;” at the end of that line.
   * When listing parameters or column names, read aloud:

     ```plsql
     PROCEDURE raise_emp_salary(   -- no semicolon yet  
       p_emp_id IN EMPLOYEES.EMPLOYEE_ID%TYPE,  -- comma!  
       p_pct    IN NUMBER,                      -- comma!  
       p_new_sal OUT EMPLOYEES.SALARY%TYPE      -- no comma, because it’s last  
     ) IS  
     ```
   * This “read aloud” habit catches stray commas and missing semicolons on the first (paper) try—something you rarely do when coding in an IDE that auto-flags you.

## 3. Handle Control Structures like a flowchart

1. **Draw Mini Flowcharts for IF/LOOP Logic**

   * If you have:

     ```plsql
     IF v_emp_sal IS NULL THEN  
       RAISE e_no_emp;  
     ELSE  
       v_new_sal := v_emp_sal * (1 + p_pct/100);  
     END IF;  
     ```
   * Quickly sketch a tiny arrowed box:

     ```
     [Fetch salary]  
           ↓  
       v_emp_sal NULL? → Yes → Raise e_no_emp  
                     ↓ No  
                 Calculate new salary  
     ```
   * **Why?** On paper, it’s easy to forget your `END IF;` or write `ELSIF` instead of `ELSE` (or vice versa). A miniature flowchart ensures you know exactly how many blocks you opened and where they close.

2. **Count Your BEGIN/END Pairs**

   * If you’ve got:

     ```plsql
     BEGIN  -- outer  
       BEGIN  -- inner (for SELECT…EXCEPTION)  
         SELECT…  
       EXCEPTION  
         WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN …  
       END;  -- closes inner  
       UPDATE…  
     EXCEPTION  
       WHEN OTHERS THEN …  
     END;  -- closes outer  
     ```
   * Write a small tick (“✔”) next to each BEGIN as you write it, then match it with an END. Number them if you must:

     ```
     1. BEGIN (outer)  
        2. BEGIN (inner)  
        2. END;  <-- closes inner  
        UPDATE…  
     1. END;    <-- closes outer  
     ```
   * This prevents you from ending the outer block too early or forgetting an `END` entirely.

---

## 4. Exception Handling: Don’t let it bite you

1. **List Out Possible Errors Beforehand**

   * Know that `SELECT … INTO` can throw NO\_DATA\_FOUND or TOO\_MANY\_ROWS. If your query might return >1 row, explicitly handle TOO\_MANY\_ROWS, or rewrite the query to guarantee 0 or 1 row.
   * If you update a row that doesn’t exist, you can check `SQL%ROWCOUNT` afterward. Don’t assume your UPDATE will always affect 1 row.
   * **On paper**, jot “Possible errors: NO\_DATA\_FOUND, TOO\_MANY\_ROWS, others” in the margin. Then, when writing:

     ```plsql
     EXCEPTION  
       WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN  
         DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No employee');  
       WHEN TOO_MANY_ROWS THEN  
         DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Data corrupted—multiple employees');  
       WHEN OTHERS THEN  
         RAISE;  
     ```
   * Having that margin note catches you before you forget a handler.

## 5. Practice with Mock “Pen-and-Paper” Problems

1. **Set a Timer and Use Just Paper**

   * Print out or draw the HR schema box (the same one the exam will give you).
   * Pick a small problem—e.g., write a procedure to “give all employees in department 50 a 5% raise”—and try to write it in 10-15 minutes on blank paper.
   * Resist the urge to test it—treat it like the real exam. Then, compare your written code to a version you type into SQL Developer later. Note every syntax mistake you made on paper (missing semicolons, mismatched BEGIN/END, wrong exception names, etc.).

2. **Memorize Common Patterns**

   * “Fetch…INTO…IF NO\_DATA\_FOUND…UPDATE…COMMIT…” becomes muscle memory. On the exam, you won’t need to think, “How do I update and commit?”—you’ll just write it.
   * Write out the “procedure template” over and over until you can draw it blindfolded:

     ```plsql
     CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE proc_name (  
       p_param1 IN …,  
       p_param2 OUT …  
     ) IS  
       -- local variables  
       e_custom EXCEPTION;  
       PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(e_custom, -20001);  
     BEGIN  
       -- main logic  
     EXCEPTION  
       WHEN e_custom THEN …  
       WHEN OTHERS THEN RAISE;  
     END proc_name;  
     /  
     ```
   * This way, you’re not inventing wheel syntax on the exam—you’re just filling in blanks.

## 6. Embrace the “You’ll Not Get It Perfect the First Time” Mentality

* **Yes, USBs and paper-coding both require a “flip it again” moment**. Nobody’s PL/SQL comes out flawless on the first stroke. Your goal on paper is to **minimize** those errors, not magically eliminate them.
* **Double-check** every critical piece:

  1. Procedure/Function name spelled correctly in both `CREATE` and `END`.
  2. Every variable uses `%TYPE` or a datatype that actually exists in the HR schema.
  3. Every SQL statement has the correct `INTO` or `FOR UPDATE` or whatever the question demands.
  4. You matched every `BEGIN` with an `END [name];` and every `IF` with an `END IF;`.
* If you catch two or three screw-ups on paper before you finish writing, count it as a win. Real-world coding IDEs catch the other half when you paste it into PL/SQL Developer—but the exam doesn’t give you that luxury.

### TL;DR

1. **Sketch your block skeleton** first—so you know exactly how many `END`s you need.
2. **Write declarations in a clear, ordered list** (exceptions, cursors, vars).
3. **Outline logic in pseudocode or a tiny flowchart** so you never freeze mid-sentence.
4. **Dry-run each SQL/PLSQL statement** mentally (or on scrap) to catch “no data found,” “missing semicolon,” etc.
5. **Practice “pen-and-paper” problems under time pressure** so you build muscle memory for syntax.
6. Accept that **first-try perfection is a myth**, but do everything you can to make that first pass as solid as possible.

So yes—nobody expects your PL/SQL to compile perfectly on the first try when you’re under exam pressure. The trick is to **simulate** that pressure during your prep sessions, catch as many mistakes as you can on paper, and build those “flip it again” instincts into smart habits. And hey, if you still plug in the semicolon upside-down once in a while, at least you’ll know why. Good luck, champ—go face that paper like it owes you nothing.
